(JMP, joint with Douglas Barthold) </a> </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote>Substitution of brand to generic drugs whenever possible has been proposed as an effective way to control prescription drug expenditure growth in the United States. This work investigates whether mandatory switching and presumed consent laws are effective in increasing generic drug use. The analysis uses plausibly exogenous changes in states' drug substitution policies to identify these policies' effects on consumer's demand for generic drugs. The Difference-in-Difference regression results indicate that mandatory switching laws have little effect. On the other hand, presumed consent laws, whereby the pharmacists could assume patient's consent to switch to generic drugs, reduce consumers' probability of purchasing brand drugs by 4.1 percentage points. We construct and estimate a bounded rationality model to explain why presumed consent laws work. In the model, consumers in states with presumed consent laws incur a cost when asking the pharmacists for brand drugs. We find that the presumed consent laws' effect in decreasing brand drug use is equivalent to about 3 dollars increase in the brand drug price. The average marginal effect of the policy is to reduce the probability of purchasing brand drugs by 6 and 11 percent. A welfare calculation indicates that consumer's surplus loss exceeds the insurance's gain by 7.5 dollars per person per purchase when states switch from the explicit to presumed consent law.</blockquote>
		<li> How Does the New Cooperative Medical Scheme Vary Cross Counties and Over Time ? </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> China initiated the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) for rural residents in 2003. The literature has evaluated NCMS' s impacts on enrollees' healthcare service utilization, medical expenditure and health status. However, the existing works ignored the heterogeneity of the NCMS's crucial characteristics, for instance the insurance's deductible and copayment level. Ignoring these varations prevent researchers from providing a complete and convincing statement of NCMS's impacts. I collect policy documents released by county governments and create a novel NCMS policy dataset. The dataset covers eight provinces in China that vary substantially in geography and economic development. It spans from 2003 to 2014 and includes about 1800 unique county year observations. Using this dataset, I present evidences of the heterogeneity of the NCMS. I find that the plans differ greatly in several dimensions:  the level of deductible, reimbursement rate and maximum reimbursement amount. To deal with the non-linear feature of most NCMS plans, I simulate 100 draws from a distribution fitted to the actual medical expenditure in China. I calculate the average reimbursement rate by applying the NCMS plans to the simulation draws. I find the average reimbursement rates vary greatly over different types of hospitals and cross counties. These findings imply that future research evaluating the NCMS should caution against treating NCMS as a homogeneous insurance and incorporate its heterogeneities. </blockquote>
		<li> Mortality Belief, Individual Health Shocks and Smoking Decision </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> This paper tries to understand the relationship between individuals’ subjective estimate of their susceptibility to smoking and their smoking decisions. I investigate how individual’s smoking related health shocks affect their subject belief of susceptibility to smoking and promote cessation behaviour. I develop a three period decision model of smoking. Based on the model, I derive two testable hypotheses. They are: (1) Smokers update their subjective estimate of own suscepbility of smoking when receiving smoking related disease diagnoses. (2) An increase in the awareness of own susceptibility will promote cessation. I use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to test these hypotheses. I implement an approach similar to the Difference-in-Difference (DID) to test the first hypothesis. The dependent variable is the change in their survival belief to age 75 in two adjacent waves of HRS survey. I find that the difference in the survival belief between smokers who received smoking related health shocks or not is significantly larger than that of non-smokers. The joint F test for smoking related shocks is significant at 5 percent level. I implement a probit regression to test the second hypothesis. The dependent variable is whether a smoker quits smoking in the next wave of the survey. The regression results suggest that the onset of smoking related diseases promotes cessation. This supports hypothesis two since these shocks increase the awareness of own susceptiblity. Combining the two results together, I find individual’s health shocks promote smoking cessation and the mechanism is that smokers could get a more precise understanding of their own susceptibility of smoking. Policy makers can mandate preventative health check-ups for smoking related health diseases to promote cessation behaviors. </blockquote>
