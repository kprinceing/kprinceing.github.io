(JMP, joint with Douglas Barthold) </a> </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> Substituting generic for brand drugs whenever possible has been proposed as an effective way to control prescription drug expenditure growth in the United States. This work investigates whether mandatory switching and presumed consent laws are effective in increasing generic drug use. The analysis uses plausibly exogenous changes in states' drug substitution policies for identification. The Difference-in-Difference regression results indicate that mandatory switching laws have little effect. However, presumed consent laws, whereby the pharmacists could assume patients' consent to switch to generic drugs, reduce consumers' probability of purchasing brand drugs by 4.1 percentage points. We construct and estimate a bounded rationality model to explain why presumed consent laws work. In the model, consumers in states with presumed consent laws incur a cost when asking pharmacists for brand drugs. We find that presumed consent laws' effect in decreasing brand drug use is equivalent to increasing the brand drug price by 3 dollars. The average marginal effect of the policy is to reduce the probability of purchasing brand drugs by 6 and 11 percent. A welfare calculation indicates that consumers' surplus loss exceeds the insurances' gain by 7.5 dollars per person per purchase when states switch from explicit to presumed consent laws. </blockquote>
		<li> How Does the New Cooperative Medical Scheme Vary Cross Counties and Over Time? </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> China initiated the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in 2003. The NCMS is a health insurance for rural residents risk pooled at the county level. The literature has evaluated NCMS's impacts on enrollees' health-care service utilization, medical expenditure and health status. However, the existing works ignored the heterogeneity of the NCMS's crucial characteristics, for instance the deductible and co-payment level. Ignoring these variations prevent researchers from providing a complete and convincing statement of NCMS's impacts. I collect policy documents released by county governments and create a novel NCMS policy data-set. The data-set covers eight provinces in China that vary substantially in geography and economic development. It spans from 2003 to 2014 and includes about 1800 unique county year observations. Using this data-set, I present evidences of the heterogeneity of the NCMS. I find that the plans differ greatly in several dimensions: the level of deductible, reimbursement rate and maximum reimbursement amount. To deal with the non-linear features of most NCMS plans, I simulate 100 draws from a distribution fitted to the actual medical expenditure in rural China. I calculate the average reimbursement rate by applying the NCMS plans to these simulation draws. I find that the average reimbursement rates vary greatly over different types of hospitals and cross counties. These findings imply that future research evaluating the NCMS should caution against treating it as a homogeneous insurance and incorporate its heterogeneities.</blockquote>
		<li> Mortality Belief, Individual Health Shocks and Smoking Decision </li>
		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> This paper tries to understand the relationship between individualsâ€™ subjective estimate of their susceptibility of smoking and their decisions to smoke. It investigates how individuals' smoking related health shocks affect their subject belief of susceptibility of smoking and promote cessation behaviour. I develop a three period decision model of smoking. Based on the model, I derive two testable hypotheses about private health shocks and individuals' belief of susceptibility to smoking. They are: (1) Smokers update their subjective estimate of own susceptibility of smoking when receiving smoking related disease diagnoses. (2) An increase in the awareness of own susceptibility will promote quitting. I use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to test these hypotheses. I implement an approach similar to the Difference-in-Difference (DID) to test the first hypothesis. The dependent variable is the change in the survival belief to age 75 in two adjacent waves of HRS survey. I find that the difference in this variable between smokers who received smoking related health shocks or not is significantly larger than that of non-smokers. The joint F test for smoking related shocks is significant at 5 percent level. This provide supportive evidence for hypothesis one. For the second hypothesis, I implement a probit regression. The dependent variable is whether a smoker quits smoking in the next wave of survey. The regression finds that the onset of smoking related diseases promotes cessation. This supports hypothesis two since these shocks increase the awareness of own susceptibility. Combining the two results together, I find individuals' health shocks promote smoke cessation and the mechanism is that smokers could get a more precise understanding of their own susceptibility to smoking. Policy makers can mandate preventative health check-ups for smoking related health shocks to promote cessation behaviors.</blockquote>
