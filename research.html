		<h4>  Abstract </h4>
		<blockquote> China initiated the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) for rural residents in 2003. There is literature that evaluates various aspects of NCMS' s impacts, including utilization, expenditure and health status. However, the current literature has paid limited attention to the heterogeneity of the NCMS's crucial characteristics. Ignoring these varations prevent researchers from providing a complete and convincing statement of NCMS's impacts. I collect policy documents released by county governments and create a novel NCMS policy dataset. The dataset covers eight provinces in China that vary substantially in geography and economic development. It spans over ten years and includes about 1800 unique county year observations. Using this dataset, I present evidence of the heterogeneity in NCMS. I find the plans differ greatly in several dimensions, the number of splines, deductible , reimbursement rate and maximum reimbursement amount. To deal with the non-linear feature of most NCMS plans, I simulate 100 draws from a distribution fitted to the actual medical expenditure in China. I calculate the average reimbursement rate by applying the NCMS plans to the simulation draws. I find the average reimbursement rates vary greatly over different types of hospitals and cross counties. These findings imply that future research evaluating the NCMS should caution against treating NCMS as a homogeneous insurance and incorporate its heterogeneities. </blockquote>
